## What this is

chat-cli — a **frameworkless** terminal AI agent: the agent loop, context-window management, tool
calling, and sub-agent delegation are hand-built on the raw `openai` SDK (no LangChain, no agent
framework). It exists to expose the machinery frameworks hide, so favour clarity over cleverness and
keep the frameworkless claim true. Source is comment-light; the "why" lives in `docs/`
(`architecture`, `agent-loop`, `database`, `rag`, `evals`, `observability`, `security`).

Stack: TypeScript ESM run via `tsx` · Ink + React 19 (TUI) · Zod (tool/output schemas) ·
drizzle-orm + better-sqlite3 · vitest (tests) · evalite (live-model evals) · oxlint/oxfmt · pnpm ·
`just` (task runner — `brew install just`).

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues are tracked as local Markdown files under `.scratch/<feature>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Triage uses the canonical `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, and `wontfix` roles. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Domain documentation uses a single-context layout. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Commands

`package.json` has only `start`; every other task is a `just` recipe (`just --list`).

- `pnpm start` — run the TUI (loads `.env`; entry `src/cli.ts` → `src/main.ts`)
- `just check` — typecheck + lint + format-check + test — the pre-commit gate
- `just test` / `just test-watch` — vitest; model is mocked, so the suite is offline (no API key)
- `just typecheck` · `just lint` (`lint-fix`) · `just format` (`format-check`)
- `just db-generate` — regenerate drizzle migrations after editing `schema.ts` (see Gotchas)
- `just db-studio` — drizzle-kit studio · `just infra` — Qdrant + Langfuse stack
- Needs a real `OPENAI_API_KEY`: `just eval` · `just integration` · `just e2e` / `just e2e-full`

## Architecture (map only — depth in `docs/`)

Three pillars — `agent/` (pure core: `step()` = one model call + `executeTool()`, all deps
injected), `store/` (SQLite via drizzle), `ui/` (Ink) — one integrator `app/` (wires them; owns the
loop in `app/runner/`, session state in `app/session/`, tool impls in `app/tools/`), and leaf infra
`platform/`. Imports use the `@/*` alias (→ `src/*`). The data flow and agent loop are in
`docs/agent-loop.md`.

- **Dependencies point one way — inward on `agent/`.** The core imports nothing from `ui/`,
  `store/`, or `app/`. Config/prompt/loop constants (model, temperature, `MAX_TOOL_STEPS`) are
  **injected**, never imported inside `src/agent/`.
- **The EventBus is UI-only and never persisted** — it carries `delta`/`tool`/`status`/`approval_*`
  for the UI; anything durable (the event log, token usage) rides in the return value.

## Conventions (the non-obvious, load-bearing ones)

- Invariants use `node:assert`, not `?? ""` or `!` — surface the bug, don't mask it.
- A function with more than two args takes one named-args object, destructured at the signature.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`: satisfy by **omitting** the prop, not passing `undefined`.
- Tools are plain async functions returning the output string; args typed via `z.infer`; progress
  via `ctx?.bus.emit(...)`. Register in `createAgentTools` (`tools` or a `forkProfiles` entry).
- **Push computation into SQL** (filter/order/limit/aggregate via drizzle — don't pull rows to loop
  in Node); batch writes go through `db.transaction`. Domain rules live on the `store/` facade;
  `OneOrMany<T>` + `asArray()` at batch boundaries. Model file: `src/store/conversation/helpers.ts`.
- `any` and non-null `!` are lint errors in `src/`. No inline rationale comments — put it in `docs/`.
- Before adding an abstraction, ask: would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated? Prefer the
  boring, direct solution; add structure only when a concrete need forces it.

## Workflow

- New feature / fix: branch off `main` (`git switch -c <type>/<slug>`); never
  commit directly to `main`.
- After finishing and passing `just check`, offer to open a PR with `gh pr create` — **always ask first**, never open one unprompted.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs static checks + unit + integration + e2e
- eval on every PR and push to `main`; keep it green.

## Gotchas / boundaries

- **Migrations:** after editing `src/store/db/schema.ts`, always regenerate with `just db-generate`
  (the only way to add a migration). Never hand-write a migration SQL file or edit
  `migrations/meta/_journal.json`.
- **Ask first:** adding any npm dep (especially an LLM/agent lib — threatens the frameworkless
  claim); changing the model, `KEEP_LAST_TURNS`, or `MAX_TOOL_STEPS`; editing `schema.ts` or the
  `Store` interface; reshaping the `TurnEvent` contract or the `Agent` step/executeTool signatures.
- **Never:** import outward from `agent/`; route storable data through the EventBus; add an
  agent framework (LangChain et al.) that hides the loop. A thin provider `Model` adapter
  (`Model.fromOpenAI` / `fromAnthropic`) for generations is fine — raw SDK clients stay at the
  composition root. Never give `delegate_task[s]` to forks (infinite recursion).
